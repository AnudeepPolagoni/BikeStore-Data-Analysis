# Project Title

## Purpose
This project aims to analyze sales data using SQL and create interactive visualizations to derive insights into revenue trends, customer behavior, and regional performance.

## SQL Query Objective
The SQL script retrieves essential information related to orders, customers, products, stores, and staff. The objective is to analyze and aggregate data to understand key metrics such as total units sold, revenue generated, and the performance of various sales elements.

## SQL Script
The SQL script used for data extraction and analysis can be found in the Bike Store Create, load and manpulations folder.

### How to Run the SQL Script
1. Ensure you have a SQL database set up with the required tables.
2. Open and execute the SQL script in your preferred SQL environment.

## Data Files
The necessary data files for this project can be found in the [Data](/Data) folder.

### Data Sources
- Include details about the origin of the data (e.g., database, CSV files).

## Visualization Files
The interactive visualizations created using Excel and Tableau are stored in the https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anudeep4846/vizzes Tableau Public.

### How to Interpret Visualizations
1. **Revenue/Year:** 
   - Interpret the line chart to observe yearly revenue trends.

2. **Revenue/Month:** 
   - Analyze the bar or line chart to identify monthly revenue variations.

3. **Revenue/State:**
   - Review the choropleth map or bar chart to understand revenue distribution across states.

4. **Revenue/Store:**
   - Explore the bar or pie chart to visualize revenue contribution from different stores.

5. **Revenue/Brand:**
   - Understand revenue distribution by interpreting the bar or stacked bar chart.

6. **Revenue/Category:**
   - Analyze the bar or pie chart to gain insights into category-wise sales.

7. **Top Customer Revenue:**
   - Identify high-value customers by examining the table or bar chart.

8. **Revenue per Sales Representative:**
   - Evaluate individual sales representative performance using the bar chart or table.

### Tools and Libraries
- SQL for data extraction and analysis.
- Excel for creating interactive dashboards.
- Tableau for advanced data visualizations.
